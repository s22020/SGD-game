1. Clone a repository
2. Download SDL devel for Visual Studio: https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases and unpack wherever you like
3. Change environment variables of lib and include directories in CMakeLists.txt to location of unpacked libraries from step 2
4. Add `lib` folder content to the location of executables (f.i. in CLion it would be cmake-debug-build")
5. Run a project
